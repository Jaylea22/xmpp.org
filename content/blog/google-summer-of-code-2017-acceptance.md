We're delighted to have been accepted in the [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) yet again. The XSF has participated in GSoC many times in the past, and it's always great to have the opportunity to work with the enthusiastic and capable students we see and to bring new views and abilities into the community.

We've got a wide range of projects offering to participate this year, and some great mentors, so this should be a really good year, all we need is the students. The XSF's ideas list is up at [https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Summer_of_Code_2017](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Summer_of_Code_2017), and if you've got ideas of your own we'll happily discuss them with you, so if you're an eligible student please get in touch, we'd love to start talking to you. If you've decided you'd like to apply for one of the great projects we have on offer, please proceed to Google's [Getting Started Page](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/get-started/).

We're looking forward to working with you over the summer!
