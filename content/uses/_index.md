It's typical for people unfamiliar with the myriad uses of XMPP to pigeonhole it into being a protocol used for [instant messaging](/uses/instant-messaging).

While that's a huge portion of XMPP traffic on the Internet, XMPP has a variety of other uses, including:

- [Internet of Things (IoT)](/uses/internet-of-things)
- [Online Gaming](/uses/gaming)
- [Social](/uses/social)
- [WebRTC](/uses/webrtc)
