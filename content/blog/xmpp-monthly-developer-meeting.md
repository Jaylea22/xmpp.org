As posted on the blog of Â Peter St.Andre, the XMPP Standards Foundation's Executive Director, the first of what will hopefully turn out to be a series of monthly XMPP developer groupchats will take place **this Thursday @ 20:00 UTC**.

The groupchat is open to all, not just to XSF members and will take place in the 'jdev' room at 'conference.jabber.org'.

[Full details can be found on Peter's blog](http://stpeter.im/?p=2528).
