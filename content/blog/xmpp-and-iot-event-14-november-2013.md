Joachim is in the US (San Francisco specifically) and would love to get together with anyone from the XMPP and/or IoT community!

His original goal was to attend the [Doing IoT with XMPP](http://www.meetup.com/technology-11/events/146609572/ "Doing IoT with XMPP") meetup. Either way you should poke him on the members@ mailing list to at least find a pub and raise a pint or three!

Thanks Joachim!
