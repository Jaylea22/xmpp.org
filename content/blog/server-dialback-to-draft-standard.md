The XMPP Standards Foundation has advanced the Server Dialback protocol specification (XEP-0220) to a status of Draft. Although this protocol was originally defined in RFC 3920, it was moved to XEP-0220 in 2007 when work began on the updated XMPP RFCs, and the documentation has been continually improved since then.
