**FriendFeed**

[FriendFeed co-founder Bret Taylor joined the Gilmore Gang podcast](http://gillmorgang.techcrunch.com/2008/11/10/gillmor-gang-111008/) to talk about their release of XMPP realtime services. The podcast is worth a listen, with the XMPP specific discussions starting at 15:30 into the show.

[IBM gave ReadWriteWeb a first look at Blue Spruce](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/ibm_blue_spruce_first_look.php), a complete browser-based application development platform that the company has been working on for the last 5 months and plans to launch around 2010. Blue Spruce combines a Co-Web Server and a Client Toolkit, which together provide a development platform that enables developers to push their applications to the browser. Server and Client communicate using XMPP.
