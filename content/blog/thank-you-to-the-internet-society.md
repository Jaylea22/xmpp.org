On December 20th 2013 the XSF received some very exciting news, to end what had already been a great year - [ISOC](http://www.internetsociety.org/blog) were awarding the XMPP community an incredibly generous gift to help support the work we are doing in improving privacy and security.

In their own words:

“The Internet Society takes a great interest in projects that will improve our existing mechanisms for on-line privacy and trust and we appreciate the XMPP Standards Foundations leadership in securing XMPP services in the wake of recent events. We know that the XMPP community is working to ensure ubiquitous TLS encryption on the public XMPP network, use DNSSEC and DANE in XMPP, more widely implement the Off-the-Record (OTR) protocol, and support both key pinning and certificate transparency.”

The XSF has already thanked them directly, but we wanted to share the great news with our wider community.

We are confident that 2014 is going to be a great year, and we look forward to sharing what this gift has enabled our community to do.

Here’s to 2014!
