Until our new website launches with a dedicated 'whats on' section, I wanted to share some events coming up that might be of interest to our community.

[Rikard Strid](https://twitter.com/rikardstrid)of Clayster is speaking at 2 events in June, focussing in on XMPP and IoT.

Fo those of you over in America (or for those that now have an excuse to head that way!) here are the details:

- 12 June: [IOT Expo](http://iot.ulitzer.com/node/3015783) in NYC
- 16 June: [IOT World](http://iotworldevent.com/open-source-iot/) in Silicon Valley

Hopefully we can get a blog post from Rikard after the events, to share the goodness with everyone that couldn't attend.
