The [RFC Editor](http://www.rfc-editor.org/) has announced that [RFC 6120](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6120.txt) (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Core), [RFC 6121](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6121.txt) (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Instant Messaging and Presence) and [RFC 6122](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6122.txt) (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Address Format) are now official RFC documents produced by the [IETF](https://www.ietf.org)!

This is a huge milestone for the XSF because it means that the core specifications for XMPP have been updated to incorporate years of implementation and deployment experience with our technologies. The basic building blocks for creating XMPP-enabled applications are more stable and more clearly defined than ever, giving developers a solid foundation for open-source projects, commercial products, and real-time services on the Internet.

Well done, XSF IETF team!
