Peter Saint-Andre has created a Manifest for others to join, debate and discuss about a plan for upgrading the XMPP network to always-on, mandatory, ubiquitous encryption.

To quote Peter:

> In short: we owe it to those who use XMPP technologies to improve the
> security of the network (and thanks to Thijs Alkemade, we now have
> better ways to test such security, using the newly-launched "IM
> Observatory" at xmpp.net). Although we know that channel encryption is
> not the complete answer, it's the right thing to do because it will
> help to protect people's communications from prying eyes.
