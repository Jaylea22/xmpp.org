The XMPP Community is one of the standard's greatest assets, full of many helpful, hard working, and inspiring people.

You can find us in a variety of places:

- Community [chat rooms](/community/chat) (of course!)
- Our [mailing lists](/community/mailing-lists)
- Attending and organizing [events](/community/events)

The XSF, XMPP's standards body, accepts members by application process. (See [more information on XSF membership here](/community/membership).)

The XSF wouldn't be possible without the support of our [sponsors](/community/sponsors). If your company is interested in [sponsoring the XSF](/community/sponsorship), we'd love to talk.
