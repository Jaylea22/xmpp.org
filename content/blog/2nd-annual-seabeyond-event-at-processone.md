ProcessOne, for the second time, will be hosting the SeaBeyond event.

This year SeaBeyond is dedicated to federated social real-time tools and mobile real-time collaboration, with more discussions about real-time technologies in general.

In the morning will be the "sandbox" where news/developments, demos and technical discussions will take place, and in the afternoon the "lighthouse" for talks and presentations.

Visit ProcessOne's [SeaBeyond website](https://www.process-one.net/seabeyond/) for full details.
