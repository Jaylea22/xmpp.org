We've scheduled [XMPP DevCon3](http://wiki.jabber.org/index.php/DevCon) for July 23 and 24, 2007, in Portland, Oregon, USA. Logistical details are being worked out right now, but save the dates if you're interested in brainstorming real-time applications with other XMPP developers in an informal, technology-focused environment.

Stay tuned for further updates in the near future.
