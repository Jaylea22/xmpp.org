Today, a large number of services on the public XMPP network permanently turned on mandatory encryption for client-to-server and server-to-server connections (there's a fine summary [here](http://blog.prosody.im/mandatory-encryption-on-xmpp-starts-today/)).

This is the first step toward making the XMPP network more secure for all users.

Stay tuned for more updates as we work on ubiquitous authentication, secure DNS, end-to-end encryption, and other improvements.
