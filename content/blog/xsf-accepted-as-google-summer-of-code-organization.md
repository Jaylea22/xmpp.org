Google has approved the XSF as a member organization for the 2010 Summer of Code!

This is a great opportunity to evangelize the XSF to young students and hopefully "hook" them on developing applications that use XMPP technologies.

Quite a few tasks are needed by members of the XSF to prepare us to receive students, one of the first is to get a list of projects for students to read about and consider.  Information and the list of projects, can be found on the [Summer of Code 2010](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Summer_of_Code_2010) XSF wiki page.

Please take the time now to review that page and add any project you think would be appropriate.

Thanks!
