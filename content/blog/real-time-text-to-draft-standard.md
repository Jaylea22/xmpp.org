The XMPP Standards Foundation has advanced XEP-0301 (In-Band Real Time Text) from Experimental to Draft in its standards process. This technology enables "conversational text" to be exchanged instantly while it is being typed or created, which has applications in live speech transcription, systems for the deaf and hard of hearing, and other situations where speech is not practical.
