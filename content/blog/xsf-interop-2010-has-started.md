XSF is conducting an online interop event to allow testing of interoperability based on the latest core standards from Monday, December 6th all the way thru Saturday the 11th of December.

The event has started with all the usual fun of setting up the infrastructure required :)

Client and Server implementers are encouraged to participate, see  our [Interop](http://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Interop) page for details or to follow along as the event unfolds!
