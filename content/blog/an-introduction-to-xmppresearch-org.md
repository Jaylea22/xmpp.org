At the recent Summit 17, we were very happy to welcome Dominik Renzel and István Koren from the recently launched site [xmppresearch.org](http://www.xmppresearch.org/). The declared mission of the project is to:

    "collect and to present scientific research work based on XMPP"

The site, which is a collaboration between RWTH Aachen University and Technische Universität Dresden, contains articles on recent XMPP-related research, demos and a comprehensive bibliography. They've recently blogged about [their experiences at Summit 17](http://www.xmppresearch.org/posts/xmppresearch-org-at-xmpp-summit-17/).

We're looking at ways of more formally linking this excellent site to the XSF's own online efforts. In the meantime I’m sure they would welcome you contacting them with any relevant XMPP research you are aware of so it can be included on their site.
